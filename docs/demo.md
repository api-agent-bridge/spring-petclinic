    - Run duration depends on hardware. On my laptop one round takes around 30ish min, so hour and a half for 3 (repeat 3)
    to run, use: MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp npx promptfoo eval -c queries.yaml --no-cache --repeat 3 -o results/queries-3x.json

    - to view results use npm run view from /eval folder 

## 5.1 Starting the app in mock mode

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mock
```

## 6.1 Starting Keycloak

```bash
docker compose -f keycloak/compose.yaml up -d
```

To log out of Keycloak, open <http://localhost:8180/realms/petclinic/protocol/openid-connect/logout> and confirm.

Keycloak runs at <http://localhost:8180> with the realm `petclinic`. To connect the MCP Inspector to `http://localhost:8080/mcp`:

1. In the server's OAuth settings, set the Client ID to `mcp-inspector` and leave the Client Secret empty. Without a client ID, the Inspector tries to register itself, and Keycloak refuses.
2. Uncheck "Request refresh token", next to Client ID and Client Secret. While it is checked, the Inspector asks for `offline_access`, and Keycloak refuses the sign-in with `invalid_scope`.
3. Connect, and sign in as one of two users:

| User | Password | Gets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | `read` | `mcp:tools`: the read tools |
| `write` | `write` | `mcp:tools` and `petclinic:write`: the read and the write tools |

To connect MCPJam, in the server's settings:

1. Set Authentication to OAuth.
2. Under Advanced Settings, set Registration Strategy to "Preregistration (Client Credentials)".
3. Set the Client ID to `mcp-inspector`, leave the Client Secret empty, and connect.

Keycloak reads `keycloak/petclinic-realm.json` at the first start only. After a change to that file, recreate the container with `docker compose -f keycloak/compose.yaml down` and start it again.

    #it can get super complicated with complex inputs, filtering and especially comparisons:
